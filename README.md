# Narrow-Down
# 🍜 Narrow Down Your Menu Choice App

This AngularJS web application helps users filter menu items based on a search term. Using a REST API, the app fetches a full list of Chinese menu items, searches the descriptions for matching keywords, and lets users remove unwanted items with a simple click.

## 🔍 Features

- Search menu item descriptions via a RESTful API
- Dynamically display a filtered list of matching results
- Custom directive for list rendering (`foundItems`)
- Remove items from results using "Don't want this one!" buttons
- Show "Nothing found" if no results match or if the input is empty
- Fully built with AngularJS — clean separation using controller, service, and directive

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3 (with Bootstrap)
- AngularJS 1.8.x
